# Template Studio
Template Studio is an editor/development environment for SolidCAM postprocessor templates. Created templates can be exported as a single file and used via the GPP Wizard application within the SolidCAM software.
Post-processor templates in this application are developed using a templating language called [Scriban](https://github.com/scriban/scriban).
